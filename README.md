# SFMLVS2019template
A template for SFML on Visual Studio 2019 (SFML_STATIC).
Simply edit the include and linker directory in project properties.
Or if you don't want to go through the trouble then simply put your 
SFML folder in

`D:\Libraries\SFML-2.5.1 VS 32 bit`

`D:\Libraries\SFML-2.5.1 VS 64 bit`

for 32bit and 64bit versions respectively.

E-mail me if there is any trouble.
